# Collatz Conjecture: Empirical Analysis via Parity-Run Decomposition

A comprehensive computational investigation of the Collatz conjecture through parity-run structure analysis, corrected drift methodology, and statistical validation.

## Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation and data for our empirical analysis of the Collatz conjecture. We analyze 50,000 trajectories using a novel parity-run decomposition approach, establishing mathematical properties and correcting methodological errors in previous drift measurements.

## Key Results

- **Even-Run Length Theorem**: Mathematical proof that even-run lengths equal 2-adic valuations (100% verified across 1,690,690 instances)
- **Parity Formula**: T(n) = 1.301·runs(n) + 13.16 (R² = 0.999)
- **Corrected Drift**: Mean drift = -0.289 (path-weighted) vs +1.76 (incorrect uniform weighting)
- **v₂ Distribution**: Consistent with Geometric(1/2), Chi-square p = 0.103
- **No cycles found** up to 10⁷
